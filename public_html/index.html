            <h2>Season one</h2>
            <p class="description">The first season of the American animated television series, <i><a
                    href="/wiki/Rick_and_Morty" title="Ricks and Mortz">Ricks and Mortz</a></i> originally aired in the <a

                    href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s late night programming
                block, <a href="/wiki/Adult_Swim" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a>. It premiered on December 2, 2013
                with "<a href="/wiki/Pilot_(Rick_and_Morty)" title="Pilot (Ricks and Mortz)">Pilot</a>" and ended on
                April 14, 2014 with "Ricksy Business", with a total of eleven episodes. The first season received
                critical acclaim.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Ricks convinces his daughter, Beth, and his son-in-law, Jerry, to allow their son, Mortz, to continue
                following him in his interdimensional adventures, promising that this will improve his school
                performance. Mortz, his parents and his sister, Summer, are dragged into dangerous adventures throughout
                the multiverse, which they manage to escape mostly thanks to Ricks's ingenuity.<br><br>

                When Ricks and Mortz accidentally turn the population of Earth into monsters, they move to an alternate
                dimension where the disaster was averted, leaving Beth, Jerry and Summer behind. They adapt to a
                seemingly identical reality, as they take the place of alternate versions of themselves who died moments
                before their arrival. It is revealed that Ricks keeps using Mortz as his companion, because his inferior
                brain waves neutralize Ricks's genius brain waves, making him undetectable. When Beth and Jerry go on
                vacation, Ricks and the kids have a party with numerous guests that turn the house into a mess. Ricks
                freezes time so that he and the kids can repair the house, before their parents return.</p>
